## 🎭 Mood Themes

Each mood has a handcrafted aesthetic optimized for both readability and vibes:

| Mood             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 **Rizz Focused**    | Minimal, clean, and high-contrast theme to get in the zone                 |
| 😐 **Rizz Neutral**    | Balanced, calming tones for chill or in-between coding sessions           |
| 💢 **Rizz Frustrated** | Intense, high-saturation theme for aggressive bug-hunting sessions        |
| 😴 **Rizz Tired**      | Soft, muted palette to soothe your brain and reduce visual fatigue        |

> More moods coming soon — including Sad Girl Coder, Overcaffeinated Dev, and Cracked Mode™
